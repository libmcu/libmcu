# Cleanup
The Cleanup module provides a robust mechanism for managing and releasing resources in embedded systems. It ensures that allocated resources are properly freed, preventing memory leaks and enhancing system stability.

## Features
- Resource Management: Register various resources that require cleanup, such as memory allocations, file descriptors, or peripheral handles.
- Automatic Cleanup: Ensures that all registered resources are released appropriately when no longer needed.
- Flexible Integration: Easily integrates into existing projects to manage resources effectively.
